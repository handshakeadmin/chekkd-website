        </header>

        <main>
            <h2>1. Information We Collect and Store</h2>
            <p><strong>CHEKKD takes privacy seriously.</strong> We store minimal personal information and do NOT store sensitive verification data like ID photos, bank account details, biometric data, employment records, or income information.</p>

            <p>We only collect and store:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> Name, email address, phone number, mailing address, password (encrypted)</li>
                <li><strong>Verification Completion Records:</strong> Records that you completed identity verification, bank verification, or employment verification (but NOT the actual verification documents or data)</li>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> IP address, browser type (for security and fraud prevention)</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Login history, feature usage (anonymized analytics)</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction Records:</strong> Records that verification was shared with another party (but NOT the content of transactions)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>1.1 What We Do NOT Store</h2>
            <p>CHEKKD does NOT store or retain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Government-issued ID photos or documents</li>
                <li>Bank account numbers, balances, or transaction details</li>
                <li>Biometric data (facial scans, fingerprints, etc.)</li>
                <li>Employment details, employer information, or income data</li>
                <li>Social Security Numbers or Tax IDs</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>How verification works:</strong> When you verify your identity, Plaid Identity performs the verification and provides us with a pass/fail result. We store only that you passed verification, not the underlying sensitive data.</p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p>Your data is used for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Calculate Reliability Score:</strong> Combine verification signals to generate your trust score and TrustBadge</li>
                <li><strong>Verify Identity:</strong> Prevent fraud and ensure platform integrity across marketplaces and peer-to-peer transactions</li>
                <li><strong>Provide Service:</strong> Enable account access, authentication, and features</li>
                <li><strong>Share Verification Status:</strong> When YOU choose to share your TrustBadge, we provide only your verification status and score (NOT your name, email, phone, or address)</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Service:</strong> Analyze usage patterns and optimize scoring algorithms</li>
                <li><strong>Communicate:</strong> Send important updates, security alerts, and notifications</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Data Sharing - We Don't Sell or Share Your Private Information</h2>

            <p><strong>IMPORTANT: CHEKKD does NOT sell your data. CHEKKD does NOT share your private information (name, email, phone, address) with anyone.</strong></p>

            <h3>What We Share (Only With Your Permission)</h3>
            <p>When you choose to share your TrustBadge with someone (during a marketplace transaction, hiring process, etc.), we share only:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your verification status (verified or not verified)</li>
                <li>Your reliability score and grade</li>
                <li>That you passed certain verification checks (ID verified, bank verified, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>We do NOT share:</strong> Your name, email, phone number, address, or any other personal information unless you explicitly choose to share it yourself.</p>

            <h3>Third-Party Services (For Verification Only)</h3>
            <p>We use these services to verify your identity. They process verification requests but we do not store the sensitive data they collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plaid Identity</strong> - Performs identity verification (government ID, bank account, employment checks). Plaid stores verification data; CHEKKD receives only pass/fail results.</li>
                <li><strong>Supabase</strong> - Secure database for storing your basic account info (email, phone, name, address)</li>
                <li><strong>Vercel</strong> - Website hosting infrastructure</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
            <p>We may disclose basic information if required by valid legal process (court order, subpoena), to protect our rights, prevent fraud, or ensure user safety. We will notify you of such requests unless legally prohibited.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since we store only basic account information (not sensitive verification data), our security requirements are simpler. We implement industry-standard security measures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted at rest and in transit using TLS/SSL and AES-256</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Role-based access with multi-factor authentication for staff</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Infrastructure:</strong> SOC 2 compliant hosting (Supabase/Vercel) with enterprise-grade security</li>
                <li><strong>Password Security:</strong> Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> System monitoring for suspicious activity and unauthorized access</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Sensitive verification data security:</strong> ID photos, bank details, and biometric data are handled entirely by Plaid Identity's secure infrastructure. CHEKKD never sees or stores this sensitive information.</p>

            <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain only the minimal data described in Section 1 (email, phone, name, address, verification completion records) for as long as your account is active.</p>

            <p><strong>When you delete your account:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your TrustBadge and reliability score become inactive immediately</li>
                <li>Your personal data (email, phone, name, address) is deleted within 30 days</li>
                <li>Anonymized verification records may be retained for fraud prevention and compliance</li>
                <li>Some data may be retained longer if required by law or for legal defense</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> We never stored sensitive verification data (ID photos, bank details, etc.) in the first place, so there's no sensitive data to delete.</p>

            <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
            <ul>
